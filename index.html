        <p class="info emi">‡No Cost EMI is available with the purchase of an eligible product made using qualifying
            cards on 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 18- or 24-month tenures from most leading card issuers. Eligible AirPods, HomePod
            and Beats products are available with No Cost EMI on 3- and 6-month tenures only. Monthly pricing is rounded
            to the nearest rupee. Exact pricing will be provided by your card issuer, subject to your card issuer’s
            terms and conditions. Minimum order spend applies as per your card issuer’s threshold. No Cost EMI is not
            available to Business customers and cannot be combined with Apple Store for Education or Corporate Employee
            Purchase Plan pricing. Card eligibility is subject to terms and conditions between you and your card issuer.
            Offer may be revised or withdrawn at any time without any prior notice. Terms apply.</p>

            here to see instant cashback amounts and eligible devices. Instant cashback is available for up to two
            orders per rolling 90-day period with an eligible card. Card eligibility is subject to terms and conditions
            between you and your card issuer. Total transaction value is calculated after any trade-in credit or
            eligible discount is applied. Any subsequent order adjustment(s) or cancellation(s) may result in instant
            cashback being recalculated, and any refund may be adjusted to account for instant cashback clawback; this
